# **SaferNet: Community Safety Platform for Women - README**

---

## **Project Overview**
**SaferNet** is a mobile and web-based platform dedicated to enhancing the safety and empowerment of women in their communities. The solution combines real-time communication, AI-powered threat detection, and a collaborative network involving women, local authorities, and volunteer protectors (e.g., women commandos). Through innovative technology and community engagement, SaferNet provides tools for prevention, response, and support against gender-based violence.

- **Safe Routes**: Recommends well-lit and community-verified paths based on real-time data.

### **5. Crowd-Sourced Safety Ratings**
- **Dynamic Safety Map**: Users rate locations and services, contributing to a live safety index for public reference.

### **6. Support for Survivors**
- **Counseling Services**: Direct access to helplines, legal aid, and therapy sessions.
- **AI Chatbots**: 24/7 support, transitioning to live professionals when needed.

### **7. Integration with Wearable Devices**

## **How It Works**
1. **User Registration**:
   - Profile creation includes optional emergency contacts and pre-saved medical and address information.
2. **Emergency Response**:
   - SOS activation sends the userâ€™s location and alert details to responders.
   - In-app communication connects users, local protectors, and authorities.
3. **Incident Reporting**:
   - Reports can be submitted with audio, text, or photo evidence.
   - Shared anonymously or publicly with relevant authorities for action.
4. **Community Collaboration**:
   - Women commandos and volunteers coordinate responses through a shared dashboard.
   - Insights are aggregated to identify patterns and plan interventions.

## **Implementation Approach**
- **Pilot Testing**: Launch in high-risk areas to refine features and gather feedback.
- **Collaborations**: Partner with NGOs, womenâ€™s organizations, and government bodies to maximize outreach.
- **Accessible Design**:
  - Offline functionality for low-connectivity areas.
  - Multilingual support and voice commands for inclusivity.
- **Community Engagement**: Foster local partnerships to build trust and active participation.
